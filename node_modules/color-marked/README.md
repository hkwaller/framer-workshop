See [orignal README](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to get understand of most options.

Addtional options include `color` and `colorscheme`

* `color` parse the css file and add inline color for the code element.

* `colorscheme` which colorscheme to use, see [highlight.js demo](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html) to get all the colorschemes and supported languages.

* The value of `langPrefix` was changed to `language-`

## Browser support

* import css file is required to display colors.

* When used in browser, import highlight.js file before marked.js file and make sure function `window.hljs` is availabel for converting.

* Use function `marked(src, option)` for markdown converting.

## Component support

Install by using [component](https://github.com/component/component) command.

Syntax highlight is enable by default, default colorscheme is `solarized_light`.

    component install chemzqm/marked

**Usage Example:**

``` js
var marked = require('marked');
console.log(marked('**This** is marked for [component](http://component.io/)'));
```

[demo](http://chemzqm.github.io/marked/index.html)

## Javascript API usage

``` js
// Set default options
marked.setOptions({
  gfm: true,
  tables: true,
  breaks: false,
  pedantic: false,
  sanitize: true,
  smartLists: true,
  smartypants: false,
  langPrefix: 'language-',
  highlight: function(code, lang) {
    if (lang === 'js') {
      return highlighter.javascript(code);
    }
    return code;
  }
});
console.log(marked('i am using __markdown__.'));
```

You also have direct access to the lexer and parser if you so desire.

``` js
var tokens = marked.lexer(text, options);
console.log(marked.parser(tokens));
```

``` js
var lexer = new marked.Lexer(options);
var tokens = lexer.lex(text);
console.log(tokens);
console.log(lexer.rules);
```


``` bash
$ node
> require('marked').lexer('> i am using marked.')
[ { type: 'blockquote_start' },
  { type: 'paragraph',
    text: 'i am using marked.' },
  { type: 'blockquote_end' },
  links: {} ]
```

## Running Tests & Contributing

If you want to submit a pull request, make sure your changes pass the test
suite. If you're adding a new feature, be sure to add your own test.

The marked test suite is set up slightly strangely: `test/new` is for all tests
that are not part of the original markdown.pl test suite (this is where your
test should go if you make one). `test/original` is only for the original
markdown.pl tests. `test/tests` houses both types of tests after they have been
combined and moved/generated by running `node test --fix` or `marked --test
--fix`.

In other words, if you have a test to add, add it to `test/new/` and then
regenerate the tests with `node test --fix`. Commit the result. If your test
uses a certain feature, for example, maybe it assumes GFM is *not* enabled, you
can add `.nogfm` to the filename. So, `my-test.text` becomes
`my-test.nogfm.text`. You can do this with any marked option. Say you want
line breaks and smartypants enabled, your filename should be:
`my-test.breaks.smartypants.text`.

To run the tests:

``` bash
cd marked/
node test
```
